Executive Summary
The Pet Shop DApp serves as a blockchain-based platform facilitating decentralized and secure transactions involving pets, encompassing purchase, sale, adoption, and management, alongside associated services. Capitalizing on blockchain technology, this innovative solution disrupts the conventional pet industry by introducing transparency, immutability, and confidence to diverse stakeholders, ranging from pet enthusiasts, breeders, and veterinarians to shelters and pet owners.

For the present endeavor, we are adopting the Pet Shop DApp from the truffle box. Concurrently, our project harnesses essential tools like the Node Package Manager (npm), the truffle framework, Ganache, and Metamask. Following the petshop tutorial, we have successfully integrated features 2, 7, 9, and 13. Moreover, to refine search outcomes, we have extended the functionality by incorporating feature 5 into the final project.

1. voting for best pets (feature 2)

2. filtering for a list of pets (feature 5)

3. Keeping track of and publishing the most adopted breed (feature 7)

4. Keeping track of which pet belong to which owner (feature 9)

5. returning a pet for a fee (feature 13)
